🙋🏻‍♂️ Hi! I'm Cerciber.

I consider myself a person who is very passionate about technology 🖱️. I believe that programming has a great capacity to change the world 🌎 and I want to be part of that change by creating incredible products 🛠️ that contribute to a more just and balanced world in all aspects of life ⚖️.

👨🏻‍💻 I got into programming for more than 8 years where I have learned many things 🧠, I have developed video games 🕹️, desktop applications 🖥️, web applications 🖼️ and servers 💭. I am currently very interested in expanding my web development skills by contributing to interesting and innovative projects with **Vue.js** and **Node.js** 🌐 as well as teaching others that software is something fascinating, exciting and that really anyone can create amazing things just by having a pc.

🙇🏻‍♂️ Strive to be happy and live peacefully with you and your community!! 🤗.
