🙋🏻‍♂️ Hi! I'm Cerciber.

🙇🏻‍♂️ I consider myself a person who is very passionate about technology. I believe that programming has a great capacity to change the world and I want to be part of that change by creating incredible products that contribute to a more just and balanced world in all aspects of life.

👨🏻‍💻 I got into programming for more than 8 years where I have learned many things, I have developed web applications, servers, desktop applications and mobile applications. I am currently very interested in expanding my web development skills by contributing to interesting and innovative projects as well as teaching others that software is something fascinating, exciting and that really anyone can create amazing things just by having a pc.

🙇🏻‍♂️ Strive to be happy and live peacefully with you and your community!! 🤗.
